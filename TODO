- Add more fetch options:
  hashtags, ages, and regions. See 'http-links' file for more info.
  Command example: cbcenter fetch-others -g c -a 20:25 -r NA,SA -o 12 -l 40 -h bigheart
  -g --> gender
  -a --> ages range
  -r --> regions
  -o --> offset
  -l --> limit
  -h --> hashtags
  An implementation with 'getopts' is probably better due to the use of
  modifiers/switches (-x).
- Open the first file in a directory, instead of the entire directory:
  This way you can use a greater variety of image viewers.
+ Add 'fetch-more user' command, to fetch more rooms like 'user'.
